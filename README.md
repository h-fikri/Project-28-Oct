# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Your Task
Personal Comment on this week's Challenge.

Making a website from scratch is my first time try while I tried cloning a website before with code along video tutorials.
This trial seems a bit 

There will be some minor improvement after I submit it that warrants resubmission. But so far, I am pretty happy with the result. 

My main challenges during the task are as belows:
* CSS Grid: adjusting the proper grid throughout the website is really hard. I have tried and error many times, even deleting all of the main section and started again from scratch (within the main/body section)
* Media Queries: getting the proper media queries has been succesfully on one limitation, that is small/medium screen. Further developement could be in more variation of medium, such as small, medium, and large screen. But so far, I'm still learning on how to do that. 
* Code duplication: the code duplication and refactoring them appears to be hard as I sometimes forgot why I put that code in the first place and as a result I have a sphaghetti code. 

Hopefull the more I practice, the more I understand how to properly build a website in a more structured way. 

Thank you for marking my task. 

## Your Task

This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 
 
With these points in mind, in this challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
